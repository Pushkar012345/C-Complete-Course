//we have different ways to declare a vector
//1)vector with no length and element specified
//vector<int> vect1;
//2)vector of length 4 and no elements
//vector<int> vect1(4);
//3)vector made from second one
//vector<int> vect3(vect2);
//4)vector with length 6 and all lements being 3
//vector<int> vec4(6,3);
